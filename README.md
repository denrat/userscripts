# Userscripts
Hand-made userscripts I use daily.

### aze
Use it to share current web page to your phone through a QR code reader.
Just press 'A', 'Z' and 'E' consecutively, in that order, in a short amount of time to display the QR code.
'A', 'Z' and 'E' are the first three letters of the French keyboard.

[Install](https://github.com/h0d/userscripts/raw/master/script.aze.user.js)

### Oasis.Sandstorm Interface Hider
Only show Sandstorm's Oasis interface when needed, by moving the cursor to the very left of the screen.

[Install](https://github.com/h0d/userscripts/raw/master/script.Oasis.Sandstorm_interface_hider.user.js)

### LightHomie
*Turn Off The Light* Chrome extension wasn't working as I expected it to (layer showing up on non-video pages), I fixed it according to my preferences.
It grays out the page while a video is playing on YouTube to increase focus.

[Install](https://github.com/h0d/userscripts/raw/master/script.LightHomie.user.js)

## Install
In order to install these scripts, you need a userscript manager:
- GreaseMonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/))
- Tampermonkey ([Chrome/Chromium](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome), [Safari](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=safari), [Firefox](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=firefox), [Opera Next](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=opera))

Then, clicking the *Install* link under the script description should launch the extension.
